## About

C++ solutions for the problems proposed for the first half (4 months) of the subject _Data Structures and Algorithms (EDA)_ at my Computer Science bachelor's degree at Universidad Complutense Madrid. I'm the author of all the code solutions but the problems were done by [Alberto Verdejo](https://www.ucm.es/directorio?id=9469) and [Isabel Pita](https://www.ucm.es/directorio?id=8620), teachers of the subject.

The main purpose of the subject is to build data structures and algorithms with the best complexity possible, studying how to face problems with the complexity in mind. 

The repository is divided by:

- Iterative problems
- Divide and Conquer problems
- Backtracking problems
